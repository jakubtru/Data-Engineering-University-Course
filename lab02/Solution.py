In the initial DataFrame, find columns which:

For these columns, perform one-hot encoding, obtaining a separate DataFrame with encoded values
for each original column. The column names should match the values within the column, without
any prefixes or suffixes.
For example, for a column that contains 3 distinct values, red, green, and blue, column names in
the resulting DataFrame should be exactly that ‚Äì red, green, and blue.
